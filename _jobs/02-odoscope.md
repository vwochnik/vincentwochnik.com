odoscope GmbH is a start-up company offering the identically-named
operational intelligence platform odoscope. The platform optimizes the customer
experience based on previously gathered and statistically analyzed data.

The odoscope platform promises to solve a problem that afflicts many online
shop operators: Most visitors drop off at the product search because they
didn't find the products they were looking for. Based on prescriptive analysis,
the odoscope platform re-orders the search results for each visitor individually
to show the products with the most predicted interest at the top of the results.

Although most visitors drop off at the product search, online shop operators
want more transparency in knowing where visitors and groups of visitors leave
their online presence to be able to find potential weaknesses.

The assignment of this internship primarily deals with the interactive
visualization of visitor statistics giving shop operators the desired
transparency. The primary task of this internship deals with the implementation
and integration of a map showing aggregated path-ways of visitors between
pages of the online shop to
gain an overview of how visitors move within an online presence, where they enter and
leave.
